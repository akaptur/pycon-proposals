# Going Serverless with OpenFaaS, Kubernetes, and Python

## Submitted by

Michael Herman

## Description

OpenFaaS (Functions as a Service) is a framework for building serverless, event-driven functions with Docker and Kubernetes.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build and deploy a full-stack application that uses Flask (client-facing app) along with OpenFaaS to handle background processes.

## Audience

This is an intermediate-level tutorial geared toward those that have experience with full-stack web development with a Python-backend (i.e., Flask, Django) and client-side JavaScript framework or library (i.e., React, Angular, Vue). This tutorial also assumes prior knowledge of Docker and some experience working with a Docker-based microservice stack.

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to...

1. Explain what serverless architecture is and why it may be a good option for you
2. Discuss the pros and cons of using OpenFaaS over other serverless options like AWS Lambda
3. Configure and run services locally with Docker, Docker Compose, and Docker Machine
4. Install Flask, Ngnix, Gunicorn, and a serverless backend on a Digital Ocean
5. Manage, deploy, and scale the services via Kubernetes
