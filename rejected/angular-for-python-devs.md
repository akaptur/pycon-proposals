**Feedback**

*Unfortunately, I don't have a substantial amount of helpful feedback for you. Your proposal was a good one; however, we had another proposal on AngularJS, and we felt that we should accept one and only one of them, and we thought that the other talk's approach was slightly more useful.*

*I know that's not a particularly helpful response; it doesn't give you anything meaningful for future proposals, and I'm sorry for that. In cases like this, it's difficult to quantify why we preferred A over B (especially since individual committee members often disagree on questions like that).*

### Title
Intro to AngularJS for Python Web Developers

### Category
Web Frameworks

### Duration
30

### Description
*If your talk is accepted this will be made public and printed in the program. Should be one paragraph, maximum 400 characters.*

Every now and then you’ll need to make a webpage that requires a significant amount of client-side interaction. Using jQuery or plain old javascript, writing code to handle events and manipulate the DOM can be time-consuming, tedious and messy. The solution to this is AngularJS, an MVC framework for the client-side. 

### Audience
*Who is the intended audience for your talk? (Be specific; "Python programmers" is not a good answer to this question.)*

Python Web Developers (Django, Flask, etc)

### Python Level
*Level of audience expertise assumed in Python.*

Novice

###Objectives
*What will attendees get out of your talk? When they leave the room, what will they know that they didn't know before?*

By the end of the talk, attendees will be able to create interactive yet organized client-side MVC Javascript for their content-driven web app.

###Detailed Abstract
*Detailed description. Will be made public if your talk is accepted.*

Every now and then you’ll need to make a webpage that requires a significant amount of client-side interaction. Using jQuery or plain old javascript, writing code to handle events and manipulate the DOM can be time-consuming, tedious and messy. The solution to this is AngularJS, an MVC framework for the client-side. 

Web developers familiar with any of the popular Python web frameworks will easily relate to and appreciate the organization that AngularJS provides. Developers that have had to write large amounts Javascript/jQuery will appreciate how AngularJS lets you do a lot with significantly fewer lines of code.

In this talk we'll take an introductory look at AngularJS, and see how to hook that into your Python web app (samples will use Flask). By the end of the talk, attendees will be able to quickly and easily start adding rich client-side interactivity to their existing web application.

### Outline

1. Intro [1 min]
2. What we’ve done in the past [2 min]
  - javascript, but it gets messy
  - jQuery made it a little easier
  - why
3. How AngularJS fixes that [2 min]
  3.1. Code is more organized. [3 min]
    - MVC framework, like Django, Flask’s MVC framework
    - show example of view/controller
  3.2 Do more with less code. [5 min]
    - Compare to javascript/jQuery.
    - run quick demo
  3.3 Two-way data binding is easy [5 min]
    - run quick demo
    - show same code
4. How do you integrate this with Flask? [5 min]
  - show code for passing server-side models to client-side
5. List more samples of what you can do [1 min]
6. Conclusion [1 min]
7. Q&A [5 min]

### Additional Notes [optional]
*Anything else you'd like the program committee to know when making their selection: your past speaking experience, open source community experience, etc.*

Code samples will be pre-written and demoed using Plunker (kind of like iPython Notebook). In case Plunker doesn’t work I’ll have the examples on my laptop, which I can run on localhost.
